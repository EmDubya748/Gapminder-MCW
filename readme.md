## Purpose

The purpose of this project is to perform basic data analysis of a Gapminder data subset. The Gapminder dataset consists of national indicators for countries around the world. This repository contains the project that I passed at the beginning of the Udacity Data Analyst program.

Specifically, I looked at:

1. General Indicators:
    * Average Life Expectancy
    * Population

2. Economic Indicators:
    * Gross National Income (Atlas Method)
    * Inflation (%)
    * Unemployment Rate amongst people aged 24-54 (%)

3. Energy Indicators:
    * Energy Production (Tonnes of Oil Equivalent per person)
    * Residential Electricity Usage (kW-hr per person)

4. Education Indicators:
    * Mean Years in School (Males)
    * Mean Years in School (Females)

5. Health Indicators:
    * Water Availability (%)
    * Sanitation Availability (%)
    * Food Supply (Calories per person)
    * Murder Rate (Deaths per 100,000 people)
    * Suicide Rate (Deaths per 100,000 people)

## Questions

1. How have the General and Economic Indicators changed between 2000 and 2016?

2. Do any of the more subjective or indirect indicators (Energy, Education, Health) correlate with GNI?

3. What are some differentiators between countries with the top 15 % of GNI versus the bottom 15 % of GNI?

## Methods Used

Basic data visualization

## Getting Started

1. Clone this repository ([Instructions](https://help.github.com/en/articles/cloning-a-repository) for cloning)

2. Raw data is uploaded with this repository for convenience. The files are csv files and less than 1 MB. Data can also be retrieved from the [Gapminder](https://www.gapminder.org/data/) website.

3. Package requirements can be found in the requirements.txt file.

## Limitations

This project was focused primarily on a high level Data Analysis process (High-level Data Wrangling, Exploratory Data Analysis, Conclusions). We focused most on the Exploratory Data Analysis part.
